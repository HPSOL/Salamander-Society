# Breeding
2 Genesis Salamanders are necessary for breeding. There are 2 ways to guarantee the successful hatch of an egg:
  1) Buying an Incubator. There will be a stealth launch of 250 incubators at some point. They will cost 125 $Insect. Incubators will be tradeable.
  2) Using at least one Salamander with the Priest role for breeding will guarantee success. Otherwise there is a 30% chance that the breeding will fail.
     Using at least one Salamander with the Alchemist role for breeding the Baby Salamander will become posionous. 
      Poisonous Salamanders will become extremely valuable.( # Whitepaper )
